# ShootWaste Multiplayer Testing Guide

## üè† **Local Testing Setup**

You can test the multiplayer mode **locally** without deploying to Firebase! Here's how:

### **Option 1: Using Vite Dev Server (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the local development server (usually at `http://localhost:5173`)

### **Option 2: Using Firebase Hosting Emulator**
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase serve
```
This serves the built version locally (usually at `http://localhost:5000`)

## üîó **How to Test Multiplayer Locally**

### **Method 1: Multiple Browser Windows/Tabs**
1. Open the game in **multiple browser tabs** or **different browser windows**
2. Each tab/window acts as a separate "device"
3. Create a game in one tab, join from another tab

### **Method 2: Multiple Browsers**
1. Open the game in **Chrome**
2. Open the same URL in **Firefox** or **Safari**
3. Test cross-browser multiplayer functionality

### **Method 3: Multiple Devices on Same Network**
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Find your computer's local IP address:
   - **Windows**: `ipconfig` (look for IPv4 Address)
   - **Mac/Linux**: `ifconfig` or `ip addr show`
3. Access the game from other devices using: `http://YOUR_IP:5173`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`

## üì± **Testing on Mobile Devices**

### **Same Network Method**
```bash
# Start dev server with host option
npm run dev -- --host
```
Then access from mobile: `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5173`

### **Vite Network Access**
The dev server will show something like:
```
Local:   http://localhost:5173/
Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
```
Use the Network URL on other devices.

## üî• **Firebase Integration Works Locally**

The Firebase Realtime Database connection works from local development because:
- ‚úÖ **Firebase config** is already set up in the code
- ‚úÖ **Database rules** allow access from any origin during development
- ‚úÖ **Real-time sync** works across all connected clients
- ‚úÖ **No CORS issues** with Firebase services

## üß™ **Local Testing Steps**

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --host
   ```

2. **Open multiple instances**:
   - Tab 1: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Tab 2: `http://localhost:5173` (new tab)
   - Mobile: `http://YOUR_IP:5173`

3. **Test multiplayer flow**:
   - Device 1: Create a multiplayer game
   - Device 2: Refresh game list and join the game
   - Both devices should sync in real-time

## üöÄ **Advantages of Local Testing**

- ‚úÖ **Instant feedback** - no deployment wait time
- ‚úÖ **Console access** - see debug logs immediately
- ‚úÖ **Hot reload** - changes reflect instantly
- ‚úÖ **Real network conditions** - test actual device-to-device gameplay
- ‚úÖ **Multiple device types** - test mobile + desktop combinations

## üõ† **Development Workflow**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev -- --host

# Terminal 2: Make changes and they auto-reload
# Test immediately across devices
```

## üìã **Quick Local Multiplayer Test**

1. Run `npm run dev -- --host`
2. Open game in 2 browser tabs
3. Tab 1: Go to Multiplayer ‚Üí Create Game
4. Tab 2: Go to Multiplayer ‚Üí Join Game (should see the created game)
5. Tab 2: Click "Join Game"
6. Both tabs should show the lobby with both players

The Firebase Realtime Database will sync the game state between all local instances just like it would in production!

## üîß **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: "Error loading games" in second device**
**Solution**: The recent fixes should resolve this. Check browser console for detailed error messages.

### **Issue: Games not appearing in join list**
**Possible causes**:
- Different language settings between devices
- Firebase database rules blocking access
- Network connectivity issues

**Debug steps**:
1. Open browser console on both devices
2. Look for detailed logging from `refreshGameList` function
3. Verify both devices have same language selected
4. Check Firebase console for database activity

### **Issue: Can't connect from mobile device**
**Solution**:
```bash
# Make sure to use --host flag
npm run dev -- --host

# Use your computer's IP address, not localhost
# Find IP with: ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Mac/Linux)
```

### **Issue: Real-time sync not working**
**Possible causes**:
- Firebase database rules
- Network firewall blocking WebSocket connections
- Browser blocking third-party cookies

**Debug steps**:
1. Check Firebase console for real-time activity
2. Test with browsers on same device first
3. Verify Firebase configuration is correct
